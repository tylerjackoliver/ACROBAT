<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

As part of ongoing research into ballistic capture, this program is designed to recreate results on identifying ballistic capture sets for generic systems in the Elliptic-Restricted Three-body Problem (ER3BP).
The program is designed to mirror the latest research on ballistic capture by Luo & Topputo, where the equations of motion are studied in a planet-centered inertial frame under the general equations of n-body motion for three bodies;
 this formulation makes the identification of stopping criteria far easier than traditional approaches in Polar coordinates under Levi-Civita regularisation found in e.g. Topputo, 2012.

This program leverages CPU parallelism to reduce program run-time.

### Built With

* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
* [BOOST](https://www.boost.org/)
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/)
* [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/math-kernel-library.html)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The dependencies given above are required prior to build. The program is currently built and tested with the Intel C++ compiler for better compiler-directed vectorisation and optimization support. GNU compilers have been tested to work, but are not officially supported.

Any compiler used must support the C++11 standard. At the moment, the program itself is not fully compliant with the Standard but will make use of C++11 intrinsics once a preliminary version is implemented.

### Building

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/tylerjackoliver/ACROBAT.git
```
2. Run the CMake wrapper
```sh
sh build.sh
```
